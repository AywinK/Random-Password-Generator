## Deployment
The web application is deployed using GitHub Pages. The webpage can be accessed at: https://aywink.github.io/Random-Password-Generator/
## Usage
### End User
Clicking the generate password button brings up a series of prompts allowing the user to select their desired custom criteria. The user is informed with an alert box when the company's password policies are not adhered to.
### Development
Files for the web application are named appropriately and placed in a logically structured folder layout.

The password requirements can be easily modified through the passwordLengthAccepted variable and the charsOptions object. No other significant changes are required for modifying the password policies.

The password generator has built in checks to ensure the user's choices are acceptable. By default, not meeting the requirements, returns an empty password.

The codebase includes comments and appropriately named expressions as variables (example shown below), so that the code is easy to understand.
